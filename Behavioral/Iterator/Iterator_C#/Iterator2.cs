// Iterator Design Pattern - Behavioral Category

// Background
// Having a collection of objects is a very common thing in software development. 
// If we have a collection of objects then we might also find ourselves in need to traverse this collection. 
// Most languages provide traversal techniques over basic collection types. 
// C# also contains some special container types capable of holding a collection of values (example: Lists, and ArrayLists in C#). 
// These specialized containers also come with the possibility of getting iterated. 
// C# container classes are the best examples of how the iterator pattern is implemented.
